To start a VM in aws firstly go to "Ec2".
Then go to launch instance.
After that  create a key pair and download it.
Then go to view instance,there we can see our instance.
Then connect it.There we can see the public and private IP's of VM.
If you want to ping your IP ,go and select an instance and then go to security where you see a edit inbound rule and in that you can chance it to "All ipv4 icmp" and "Anywhere ipv4".After that you can ping your VM.
For login through ssh 
First command "ssh -i file.pem username@ip-add"
then "chmod 0400 file.pem
after that again  ssh -i file.pem username@ip-addr
